# 📘 Episode 1 – Introduction to Node.js

## 🚀 What is Node.js?

Node.js is a **JavaScript runtime environment** built on **Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine**.  
It allows us to run JavaScript **outside the browser**, enabling **backend and server-side development** using JavaScript.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- Runs on **Windows, Linux, macOS**
- **Cross-platform** & **open-source**
- Maintained by the **OpenJS Foundation**
- Uses **event-driven architecture**
- Supports **asynchronous, non-blocking I/O**

---

## ⚙️ Why Node.js?

Before Node.js, JavaScript was limited to browsers.  
Node.js changed this by allowing JavaScript to:

- Run on **servers**
- Handle **multiple requests efficiently**
- Build **full-stack applications** using a single language (JavaScript)

---

## 🧠 Event-Driven & Non-Blocking I/O

Node.js uses a **non-blocking I/O model**, which means:

- It **doesn’t wait** for tasks (like DB queries or file access) to finish
- Handles **multiple requests** using fewer threads
- Results in **high scalability and performance**

---

## 🧑‍💻 History of Node.js

- Developed by **Ryan Dahl**
- First released in **2009**
- Initially named **Web.js**
- Renamed to **Node.js** after realizing its real power
- Built to solve the **blocking nature of Apache HTTP Server**

---

## 🕰️ Node.js Timeline (High-Level)

- **2009** – Node.js created (V8 Engine)
- **2010** – NPM introduced
- **2011** – Windows support added
- **2014** – io.js forked due to slow development
- **2015** – Node.js & io.js merged
- **2019** – OpenJS Foundation formed

---

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- **Node.js = JavaScript + V8 + Superpowers**
- Designed for **high concurrency**
- Forms the **foundation of modern backend development**
